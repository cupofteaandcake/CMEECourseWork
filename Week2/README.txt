# READ ME WEEK 2
# This file contains the practical results of the Python 1 chapter of TheMulQuaBio handbook
# The python scripts contained within the Code directory include:
# align_seqs_fasta.py, which finds the best alignment of two DNA sequences which
# are provided in a FASTA format
# align_seqs_better.py, which finds the best alignments of two DNA sequences
# align_seqs.py, which finds the best alignment of two DNA sequences
# basic_csv.py, which reads a csv and extracts certain information into a
# separate csv file
# basic_io.py, which opens, exports and stores objects from a text file
# boilerplate.py, which is a standardised python program, which prints
# 'This is a boilerplate'
# cfexercises1.py, which illustrates the use of for, while and if control
# statements in python
# cfexercises2.py, which exemplify further applications of control statements
# control_flow.py, which exemplify the use of control statements
# debugme.py, which illustrates how to use pdb
# dictionary.py, which creates a dictionary called taxa_dic, in which
# the species in taxa are organised into sets based on their taxa
# lc1.py, which runs list comprehensions and loops for creating sets based on
# the bird data provided
# lc2.py, loops and list comprehensions to create lists based on the
# Met Office data provided
# loops.py, which illustrates the use of loops in python
# oaks_debugme.py, which searches for oaks in a csv of tree species
# and prints them to a new csv file
# oaks.py, which finds just the species in taxa that are oaks
# scope.py, which demonstrates the usability of local and global variables
# sysargv.py, which illustrates how to use arguments in python
# test_control_flow.py, which illustrates the use of doctests
# tuple.py, which is a simple for loop which prints each species on a new line
# using_name.py, which highlights when a program is running by itself,
# or is acting as a module being imported from another program
