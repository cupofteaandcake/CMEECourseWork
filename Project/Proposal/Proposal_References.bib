abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Objective We explored whether use of deep learning to model temporal relations among events in electronic health records (EHRs) would improve model performance in predicting initial diagnosis of heart failure (HF) compared to conventional methods that ignore temporality. Materials and Methods Data were from a health system's EHR on 3884 incident HF cases and 28 903 controls, identified as primary care patients, between May 16, 2000, and May 23, 2013. Recurrent neural network (RNN) models using gated recurrent units (GRUs) were adapted to detect relations among time-stamped events (eg, disease diagnosis, medication orders, procedure orders, etc.) with a 12- to 18-month observation window of cases and controls. Model performance metrics were compared to regularized logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor classifier approaches. Results Using a 12-month observation window, the area under the curve (AUC) for the RNN model was 0.777, compared to AUCs for logistic regression (0.747), multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer (0.765), support vector machine (SVM) (0.743), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) (0.730). When using an 18-month observation window, the AUC for the RNN model increased to 0.883 and was significantly higher than the 0.834 AUC for the best of the baseline methods (MLP). Conclusion Deep learning models adapted to leverage temporal relations appear to improve performance of models for detection of incident heart failure with a short observation window of 12-18 months.},

abstract = {The number of service visits of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is different from each other and their visit time intervals are non-uniform. Although the literature has revealed many approaches in disease progression modeling, they fail to leverage these time-relevant part of patients' medical records in predicting disease's future status. This paper investigates how to predict the AD progression for a patient's next medical visit through leveraging heterogeneous medical data. Data provided by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center includes 5432 patients with probable AD from August 31, 2005 to May 25, 2017. Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (RNN) are adopted. The approach relies on an enhanced “many-to-one” RNN architecture to support the shift of time steps. Hence, the approach can deal with patients' various numbers of visits and uneven time intervals. The results show that the proposed approach can be utilized to predict patients' AD progressions on their next visits with over 99{\%} accuracy, significantly outperforming classic baseline methods. This study confirms that RNN can effectively solve the AD progression prediction problem by fully leveraging the inherent temporal and medical patterns derived from patients' historical visits. More promisingly, the approach can be customarily applied to other chronic disease progression problems.},

abstract = {An explosion of high-throughput DNA sequencing in the past decade has led to a surge of interest in population-scale inference with whole-genome data. Recent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methods for relatively simple model classes, and few scalable general-purpose inference techniques exist for more realistic, complex models. To achieve this, two inferential challenges need to be addressed: (1) population data are exchangeable, calling for methods that efficiently exploit the symmetries of the data, and (2) computing likelihoods is intractable as it requires integrating over a set of correlated, extremely high-dimensional latent variables. These challenges are traditionally tackled by likelihood-free methods that use scientific simulators to generate datasets and reduce them to hand-designed, permutation-invariant summary statistics, often leading to inaccurate inference. In this work, we develop an exchangeable neural network that performs summary statistic-free, likelihood-free inference. Our framework can be applied in a black-box fashion across a variety of simulation-based tasks, both within and outside biology. We demonstrate the power of our approach on the recombination hotspot testing problem, outperforming the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis, and they can affect humans of all age groups. In immunocompromised patients, norovirus infections can develop into chronic diarrhea or show prolonged asymptomatic virus shedding. Chronic norovirus infections are frequently reported for solid organ transplant recipients, with rapid intrahost norovirus evolution seen. In this report, we describe a case of chronic norovirus infection in an immunocompromised patient who was followed up for over 5 years. The purpose of the study was to specify the norovirus evolution in a chronically infected immunocompromised host and identify possible selection sites in norovirus capsid protein. During the follow-up period, 25 sequential stool samples were collected and nine of them were selected to generate amplicons covering viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and viral capsid protein (VP1) genes. Amplicons were sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were defined, which demonstrated a nearly 3-fold greater mutation rate in the VP1 genome region compared to the RdRp genome region (7.9 vs. 2.8 variable sites/100 nucleotides, respectively). This indicates that mutations in the virus genome were not accumulated randomly, but are rather the result of mutant selection during the infection cycle. Using ShoRAH software we were able to reconstruct haplotypes occurring in each of the nine selected samples. The deduced amino-acid haplotype sequences were aligned and the positions were analyzed for selective pressure using the Datamonkey program. Only 12 out of 25 positive selection sites were within the commonly described epitopes A, B, C, and D of the VP1 protein. New positive selection sites were determined that have not been described before and might reflect adaptation of the norovirus toward optimal histo-blood-group antigen binding, or modification of the norovirus antigenic properties. These data provide new insights into norovirus evolutionary dynamics and indicate new putative epitope ‘hot-spots' of modified and optimized norovirus–host interactions.},
